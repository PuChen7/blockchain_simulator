# Blockchain
## Introduction
### Block
* Timestamp
* lastHash - the hash of the previous block 
* hash - hash based on its own data
* The data

### Generating Hash
Block hash is generated by combination of `timestamp, lastHash, data, nonce, difficulty`. 

The program combines `timestamp, lastHash, data, nonce, difficulty` into one String and uses SHA256() to generate a unique hash value.

### Adding Block
First, the program gets the last block in the chain, and call `mineBlock()` which returns the newly generated block, then push the new block into the chain.

### Mining Blocks `(Proof of Work)`
Mining time is controlled by `DIFFICULTY` and `MINE_RATE` in a `do-while` loop. 

`DIFFICULTY` is used for determining how many leading zeros the unique hash contains.

`MINE_RATE` is set to 3000 milliseconds(3 seconds) initially which means it should take around `MINE_RATE` for mining the new block.

`DIFFICULTY` is recalculated in `do-while` loop:
```java
 difficulty = lastBlock.timestamp + MINE_RATE > currentTime ? difficulty + 1 : difficulty - 1;
```
