# Blockchain
## Introduction
### Block
* Timestamp
* lastHash - the hash of the previous block 
* hash - hash based on its own data
* The data

### Generating Hash
Block hash is generated by combination of `timestamp, lastHash, data, nonce, difficulty`. 

The program combines `timestamp, lastHash, data, nonce, difficulty` into one String and uses SHA256() to generate a unique hash value.

### Mining Blocks
Mining is controlled by `DIFFICULTY`.
